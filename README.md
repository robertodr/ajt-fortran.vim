# fortran.vim
Port of Ajit J. Thakkar's Vim indent script.
These are prerequisite files for the [Fortran 90/95](https://github.com/vim-scripts/fortran.vim) indent files
by SÃ©bastien Burton.
The files were downloaded from [here](http://www2.unb.ca/~ajit/download.htm)
to ease installation with Vim plugin managers.
